Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) Directory
===========================================
In order to compare the exact density fluctuation and the BES diagnostics, two classes have been created.
A first one that implement the diagnostics (:class:`BES <FPSDP.Diagnostics.BES.bes.BES>`) and a second one that copy the
structure of the diagnostics and just take density value at the focus points (:class:`BES_ideal <FPSDP.Diagnostics.BES.bes.BES_ideal>`).
