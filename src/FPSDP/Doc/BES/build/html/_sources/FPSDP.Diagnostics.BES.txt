Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) Directory
===========================================
In order to compare the exact density fluctuation and the BES diagnostic, two classes have been created.
A first one the implement the diagnostic (:class:`FPSDP.Diagnostics.BES.bes.BES`) and a second one that copy the
structure of the diagnostic and just take density value at the focus points.
