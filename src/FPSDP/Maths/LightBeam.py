    Definition
    ==========
    
    A Gaussian light beam is a monochromatic electromagnetic wave whose 
    transverse magnetic and electric field amplitude profiles are given by 
    the Gaussian function.    
    
    All notations here will follow the convention in [1]_.    
    
    Coordinates
    -----------
    
    We will use two set of frames here.
    
    1. Beam frame
        In Beam frame :math:`{x, y, z}`, :math:`z` is the central light path 
        direction, :math:`x` and :math:`y` are the two transverse directions 
        which align with the elliptical axis of the Gaussian profile. In 
        circular Gaussian case, :math:`r \equiv \sqrt{x^2+y^2}` is used.
        
    2. Lab frame
        Lab frame :math:`{x', y', z'}` will be used as in usual convention. 
        :math:`x` will be along major radius direction, :math:`y` the vertical 
        direction, and z locally toroidal direction.
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    Several parameters are usually used to describe a Gaussian beam:
    
    waist width :math:`w_0`:
        The waist, also called *focus*, is the narrowest location in the beam.
        The waist width :math:`w_0` is defined as the 1/e half-width in 
        transverse directions of field amplitude at the waist. Elliptical 
        shaped Gaussian beams may have different waist width on different 
        directions. i.e. :math:`w_{0x}` and :math:`w_{0y}`.
        
    Rayleigh range :math:`z_R`:
        Rayleigh range is the distance along the beam from the waist where 1/e
        half-width becomes :math:`\sqrt{2}w_0`. It is related to :math:`w_0` as
        
        .. math::
            z_R = \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda},
            
        where :math:`\lambda` is the wave length.
        
    Beam divergence :math:`\theta`:
        Far away from waist, the 1/e half-width is proportional to z. If we 
        draw a line along the 1/e half-width, it asymptotically has a constant
        angle with the central light path. This is defined as the beam 
        divergence. When it's small (paraxial case), it has the following 
        relation to the waist width.
        
        .. math::
            \theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{\pi w_0} \quad 
            (\lambda \ll w_0).
    
    Electric Field Expression
    ==========================
    
    The electric field complex amplitude :math:`E(x, y, z)`can be evaluated 
    using the following formula [1]_:
    
    .. math::
        E(x, y, z)=\frac{E_0}{u_x(0,0)u_y(0,0)} \mathcal{e}^{ikz} u_x(x,z) 
                    u_y(y,z),
    
    where

    .. math::    
        u_x(x,z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{q_x(z)}} 
                   \exp\left(\mathrm{i} k \frac{x^2}{2q_x(z)} \right),
                   
        u_y(y,z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{q_y(z)}} 
                   \exp\left(\mathrm{i} k \frac{y^2}{2q_y(z)} \right),
                   
    and :math:`k \equiv 2\pi/\lambda` is the magnitude of the wave vector,
    :math:`q(z) \equiv z-\mathrm{i}z_R` the complex beam parameter. Note that
    since we are using a different convention for :math:`\omega` compared to 
    that used in Ref [1]_, namely, we assume the wave goes like 
    :math:`e^{-i\omega t}` instead of :math:`e^{i\omega t}`, we need to take 
    complex conjugate on spatial terms to keep the wave propagating in positive
    z direction. This applies to the definition of :math:`q` terms and the sign 
    in front of :math:`ik` part.
    
    Calculation of the Amplitude from Total Power
    =============================================
    
    If ``P_total`` is given, then the center amplitude :math:`E_0` will be 
    determined by it.
    
    The time-averaged Poynting flux is (in Gaussian unit):
    
    .. math::
        S_m = \frac{c}{8\pi}E_m \times B_m^*,
    
    where :math:`E_m` and :math:`B_m` are the magnitude of the field.   
    
    For our Gaussian beam at waist plane, assuming linear and constant 
    dielectric, :math:`B_m = N E_m` and they are perfectly in phase. So, 
    
    .. math::
        S_m = \frac{Nc}{8\pi}|E_m|^2.
    
    where :math:`N \equiv ck/\omega` the refractive index, 
    :math:`k=2\pi/\lambda`.
    
    The total power is then
    
    .. math::
        P_{total} = \int\int S_m \mathrm{d}x \, \mathrm{d}y 
                = \frac{Nc}{8\pi}|E_0|^2\int\int 
                \exp\left(-\frac{2x^2}{w_{0x}^2}
                - \frac{2y^2}{w_{0y}^2}\right) \mathrm{d}x \,\mathrm{d}y.
    
                
    The Gaussian integration over x and y gives us :math:`\pi w_{0x} w_{0y}/2`,
    so we have the relation between :math:`E_0` and :math:`P_{total}`:
    
    .. math::
        E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{8 \lambda \omega P_{total}}{\pi c^2 w_{0x} w_{0y}}}
        
    We choose :math:`E_0` to be real for simplicity.
    
    Coordinate Transformation
    =========================
    
    The input lab coordinates will be transformed into beam coordinates first, 
    then the complex amplitude is evaluated in beam frame using the above 
    formula.
    
    The coordinate transformation consists of 5 operations.
    
    translation:
        from lab frame origin to the beam frame origin, which is the waist 
        location.
    rotation along y' axis:
        by the angle of *tilt_h* 
    rotation along z' axis:
        by the angle of -*tilt_v*
    rotation along x' axis:
        by the angle of -*rotation*
    substitution:
        -x'->z, y'->y, z'->x
