    Inputs:
        data: 1D array, time series of the data under investigation
        time: 1D array, same length as data, the corresponding 'time' labels of the data, has unit.

        tend: int, optional, ending time for the analysis, default to be -1, which means the last time step of the given data.
        overlap_rate: double, (0,1), optional, the overlap ratio between adjacent FFT windows. It is easy to show that delta_t = (1-overlap_rate)*fft_window is the corresponding window center displacement.

        time_spec: 1D array of length NT, the center time of each spectrum.
